The Expense Tracker App is a mobile application developed using Flutter that allows users to easily track and manage their expenses. With this app, users can input their expenses and view a chart that displays their spending across four categories: food, leisure, work, and travel. The app also supports both dark and light theming to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Expense Input**: Users can easily input their expenses by specifying the expense category, amount, and date of expense. This information is used to categorize and display expenses in the chart and list.

- **Expense Categories**: Expenses are categorized into four domains: food, leisure, work, and travel. This categorization helps users get a clear overview of their spending habits.

- **Interactive Chart**: The app provides an interactive chart that visually represents the distribution of expenses across the four categories.

- **Expense List**: Below the chart, users can view a list of their expenses. Each expense entry displays the category, amount, and date of the expense. Users can also remove expenses from the list as needed.

- **Dark and Light Theming**: The app supports both dark and light theming to cater to users' preferences and provide a visually pleasing experience.
